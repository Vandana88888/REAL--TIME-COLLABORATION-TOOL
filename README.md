**DESCRIPTION OF TASK(In this task, I developed a basic Student Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to enter and manage student data, including name, age, and grade. Users can add new students to a list, view existing entries, and optionally edit or delete them. The project focuses on handling form input, dynamically updating the DOM using JavaScript, and presenting the student records in a user-friendly table format. This task helped reinforce my understanding of front-end interactivity, event handling, and data manipulation in the browser without using any backend or database.)
